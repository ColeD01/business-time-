<div class="about-Us">
    <h2>About the Company</h2>

</div>

<div class="features">
<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>I know to the many who havent heard of our compnay it seems strange to have a whole websiste dedicated to the features of its one and only prodcut witch also happens to be toliet papaer. but looks can be deciving for while our toilet paper is not only the softest and most durable it also... never runs out and yes i do mean that literally. thanks to our break throughs in quantam mechanics, space-time studies, and multiversal travel we have created the means to make a truly infinte roll of toliet paper. meaning you'll never have to buy toliet paper again Ever! </h4>

<div class="pricing">
<h2>Pricing</h2>
<h4>Now one might ask how you go about pricing something that is infinte, and if were one of the othe major brands that might involve making you break the bank for something so useful.or not even telling you about such a discovery and charging you more without rerason. luckily we arent the major brands and here at Toliet Paper Inc. our gaol is to make buying toilet paper a thing of the past and so while the pricing at first may look a little outlandish for toilet paper just remeber that these will be the last rolls of toliet paper youll ever buy. </h4>

    <h4>Now i did mention that our company is rather new and youd think that infinite toliet paper would be a big deal and spread like wild fire buuuuut it hasnt.Now that being said our availability is kinda iffy in certain parts of the U.S (We are an American based compnay Bummer I know we havent gone international yet sorry). so just enter in a state(use your states initials and make sure their capitilized)in the box and the site will let you know if you are able to purchase.</h4>
